base.py is the code file

Run test.py to execute one episode of the algirithm. A graph will appear. 

Run fig5.py to reproduce Figure 5, but it won't be exactly the same because the policy is stochastic. 
Sometimes lambda_v = 0.7 can produce numerically unstable results when T is large (like 10000). In this case, the user can lower lambda_v to something like 0.2. 

Run fig4.py to reproduce Figure 4, but it won't be exactly the same because the policy is stochastic.
